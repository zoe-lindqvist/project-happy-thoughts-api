# Project Happy Thoughts API

This project focused on building a custom API enabling users to post "happy thoughts," like posts, and view the 20 most recent thoughts. The API was built to replace the original Technigo-provided API, ensuring compatibility with the existing frontend while enhancing functionality and data validation.

## The problem

To address the project requirements, I created a MongoDB database using Mongoose for data management. I built endpoints to fetch, create, and update thoughts while validating user input and ensuring clean data storage.

## Technologies used

- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
